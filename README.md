# graynoise
A place for my modular synthesizer designs. Generally openable in [kicad](https://kicad.org/). Or, if you trust me, zip up the gerber directories and send them to your favorite PCB house. If you don't have a favorite, I can recommend PCBWay. Parts are generall available from either Tayda or Mouser.

## 4mixer

## Offset Attenuverter
