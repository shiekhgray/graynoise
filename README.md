# graynoise
A place for my modular synthesizer designs. Generally openable in [kicad](https://kicad.org/). Or, if you trust me, ship the zipped gerber directories to your favorite PCB house. If you don't have a favorite, I can recommend PCBWay. Parts are generally available from either Tayda or Mouser.

Each directory should be a module, with two kicad projects. One should be the actual schematic and logic boards, the other a faceplate.

## 4mixer
A small, 4hp, 4 channel mono mixer for Eurorack in kicad

## Offset Attenuverter
A 4hp dual attenuverter with offset function, useful for sidechain compression, FM and AM intensity control, and other CV management
